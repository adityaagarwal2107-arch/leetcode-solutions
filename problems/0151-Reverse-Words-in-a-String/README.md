### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.*

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** s = "the sky is blue"
**Output:** "blue is sky the"

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** s = "  hello world  "
**Output:** "world hello"
**Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** s = "a good   example"
**Output:** "example good a"
**Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`

	- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.

	- There is **at least one** word in `s`.

 

**Follow-up: **If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?
